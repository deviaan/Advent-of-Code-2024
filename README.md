My solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code challenge.

I decided to learn C#, so I'm using this practice with the language. The code is not great, there's a lot of stuff that is probably weird since I'm trying to not have any warnings.

Solutions are all pretty naive, I'm not the best at this kind of puzzle.
